# cargo-temp

A CLI tool for linux (actually) that allow you to create a temporary new rust project using cargo with already installed dependencies.

## Features

If after a bit of play with you project you want to keep your work, just delete the to_delete file generated by cargo-temp

We will use a config file that allow you to decide where you want to generate your temporary project (its in your cache directory by default).

## Usage

Create a new project, with no additional dependencies:

`$ cargo-temp`

Create a new project, with two dependencies (as foo and bar):

`$ cargo-temp foo bar`

Create a new project, with a dependency who have a fixed version:

`$ cargo-temp foo=3.2`
