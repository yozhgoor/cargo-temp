# cargo-temp

A CLI tool for linux (currently) that allow you to create a new rust project in a temporary directory with already installed dependencies.

Only *nix OS are supported for now because a shell is ran while the project is being edited by the user.
It would be nice to have this working on Windows.
If you know how to this, please open an issue to tell us (or a PR.)

## Features

If after a bit of play with you project you want to keep your work, just delete the to_delete file generated by cargo-temp

We will use a config file that allow you to decide where you want to generate your temporary project (its in your cache directory by default).

## Usage

Create a new temporary project:

* With no additional dependencies:
    `$ cargo-temp`

* With multiple dependencies:
    `$ cargo-temp rand tokio`

* With a dependency that have a fixed version:
    `$ cargo-temp anyhow==1.0.13`
