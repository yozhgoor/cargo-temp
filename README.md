# cargo-temp

A CLI tool for linux (currently) that allow you to create a temporary new rust project using cargo with already installed dependencies.

## Features

If after a bit of play with you project you want to keep your work, just delete the to_delete file generated by cargo-temp

We will use a config file that allow you to decide where you want to generate your temporary project (its in your cache directory by default).

## Usage

Create a new project:

* With no additional dependencies:
    `$ cargo-temp`

* With two dependencies:
    `$ cargo-temp rand serde`

* With a dependency that have a fixed version:
    `$ cargo-temp anyhow=1.0`
